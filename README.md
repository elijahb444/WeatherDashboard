# WeatherDashboard

## Description

This project is a simple(ha) website that uses the OpenWeatherAPI to fetch forecast data based on a city that the user inputs. 

The javascript contains two fetch calls: The first is to get the coordinates of the user's city, then it passes those coordinates to another function that will use that data to return the forecast for those coordinates. It also saves past searches to local storage and displays them, so that a user can easily see the forecast for cities they've searched before.

This project served as a great avenue for me to grow familiar with API calls, as well as manipulating the data returned to me and displaying it on the page.
